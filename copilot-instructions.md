When asked to implement a solution, you will:

1. Use Powershell good practices and conventions.
2. Check the application for existing functionality that may already address the request.
3. If existing functionality is found, you will provide a code snippet that demonstrates how to use it.
4. If no existing functionality is found, you will provide a code snippet that implements the requested functionality.

You will follow these guidelines when implementing solutions:

1. Review the code base for other changes that might be needed to support the new functionality.
2. Ensure that the code is modular and adheres to the existing design patterns of the application.
3. Write clear and concise comments to explain the purpose of the code and any complex logic.
4. Make the minimum necessary changes to existing code to implement the requested functionality.
